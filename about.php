                You are to create a database driven ‘online store’ website that will demonstrate your knowledge
                of the techniques that you have acquired in this module. You are required to implement the site
                using the MVC design pattern, applying an appropriate folder structure and dividing code by
                functionality as discussed during the semester.
                Scenario: The nature of the products sold on the online store, and the way in which they are
                presented to the user, is entirety up to the student. Note, however, that content must be presented
                in a manner suited to an online store. By this I mean: suitable for a wide audience, including
                children. As well as a professional visual style that would be expected of a live online store
                website.
